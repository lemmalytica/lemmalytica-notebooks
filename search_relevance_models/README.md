## Introduction to Search Relevance Models

This notebook introduces methods for assessing the degree to which a document is relevant to a basic search query. Concepts discussed in this exploration include the *bag-of-words* model and the *term frequency-inverse document frequency* model. As a sample data set, this exploration uses 228 State of the Union (SOTU) speeches by U.S. presidents between 1790 and 2018.
